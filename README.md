This project was presented as a final work in the course of graphic Computing of the PESC (Programa de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computação)

In this project, a virtual environment was constructed using the OpenGL library and the sensor Leap Motion (www.leapmotion.com) was used in order to improve the user interaction. The version of the Leap Motion library was 2.2.4+26750.
DevIL (Developer's Image Library - https://github.com/DentonW/DevIL) was used to load and treat images for texture in OpenGL.

To compile env3D_v1_3.cpp is necessary to install de Leap Motion and DevIL librarys.

The video CG_Project.mp4 show the result of this program. It is possible to see that the method of Shadow Mapping was applied.
