This project was presented as a final work in the course of Graphic Computing of the Program of Systems and Computing Engineering (Programa de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computação - PESC) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro - UFRJ).

In this project, a virtual environment was constructed using the OpenGL library and the sensor [Leap Motion](www.leapmotion.com) was used in order to improve the user interaction. The version of the Leap Motion library was 2.2.4+26750. Besides,
[DevIL](https://github.com/DentonW/DevIL) (Developer's Image Library) was used to load and treat images for texture in OpenGL.

To compile env3D_v1_3.cpp is necessary to install de Leap Motion and DevIL librarys.

The video [CG_Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyO3r7zPjxI) show the result of this program. It is possible to see that the method of Shadow Mapping was applied.
